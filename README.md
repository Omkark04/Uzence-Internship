# React UI Components

A small component library built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and Storybook.

## Setup
1. Clone repo
2. npm install
3. npm run dev (or npm run storybook)

## What I built
- InputField: flexible input with states and variants.
- DataTable: sortable, selectable, responsive table.

## Notes
- Accessibility: ARIA attributes for inputs and checkboxes present.
- Tests via @testing-library/react# Uzence-Internship
